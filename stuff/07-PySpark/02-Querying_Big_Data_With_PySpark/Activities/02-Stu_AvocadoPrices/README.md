# Reading From S3

In the previous activity, students started to look at how to read a file from S3 in PySpark. In this activity, they will have the opportunity to practice this skill. They will read the `avocado.csv` file into PySpark. This is a skill that students will use in their careers, so it is important to understand how to do this. Many organizations use S3 to store files.

## Instructions

1. Write a PySpark script to read the [avocado.csv](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-netflix/unit-7/avocado.csv) file in.
