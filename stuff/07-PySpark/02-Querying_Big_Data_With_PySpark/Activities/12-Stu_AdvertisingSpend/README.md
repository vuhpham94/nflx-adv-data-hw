# Advertising Spend

In the previous activity, students learned how to use User Defined Functions or UDF's. In this activity, they will have an opportunity to practice creating a UDF and implementing it in PySpark. As a Data Engineer, this is a common functionality that students will use. This will help students write more complex code and functionality.

## Instructions

1. Read the [AdvertisingSpend.csv](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-netflix/unit-7/AdvertisingSpend.csv) file into PySpark.

2. Create a new User Defined Function that divides the advertising spend dollars into millions of dollars.

3. Use this new User Defined Function to return the source and the dollars amounts as millions of dollars for the years 2020 through 2024.
