# Michelin Star Dining with RDS

In the previous activity, students had an opportunity to learn more about connecting to an RDS database and inserting records into a table. In this activity, students will have a chance to practice this skill. As a Data Engineer, students will be expected to know how to work with S3 and PySpark, as these are common tools. They will also be expected to connect to an RDS database from PySpark.

## Instructions

1. Read the [michelin_star_dining.csv](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-netflix/unit-7/michelin_star_dining.csv) file into PySpark.

2. Create a new table in RDS called `michelin_star_dining`.

3. Bulk insert the DataFrame into the `michelin_start_dining` table.
