# PySpark Demographic Filtering

In this activity, you will use the PySpark filtering functions to filter through the demographic dataset. Filtering and ordering DataFrames is an essential operation in PySpark. Data engineers often want to filter out some of the data within a dataset, or to order the data so they can view the most or least important rows first.

## Instructions

Using PySpark methods and the [demographics.csv](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-netflix/unit-7/demographics.csv) dataset, answer the following questions:

1. Which occupation had the highest salary?

2. Which occupation has the lowest salary?

3. What is the mean salary of this dataset?

4. What are the maximum and minimum values of the Salary column?

5. List all of the occupations that have salaries above $80,000.

6. **Bonus:** What is the average age and height for each academic degree type?

   * *Hint:* You will need to use `groupBy` to answer this question.
