# Austin Snow with MRJob

In the previous activity, you learned how to use MapReduce and locally test your MapReduce jobs using `MRJob`. In this activity, you will have an opportunity to practice this skill by creating a MapReduce job that lists the days in which it snowed in Austin, Texas. It is important for you to understand how to write a MapReduce job, as you may need to write or modify MapReduce jobs in your career. 

## Instructions

2. Next, import MRJob.

3. After importing MRJob, create a new class, which will contain your mapper and reducer.

4. Create mapper and reducer functions that return the days in which it snowed in Austin, Texas. 

5. **Bonus:** Find the maximum amount of snow per date.
