# 2.2 Skill Drill

For this skill drill, you will be importing a CSV file into a DataFrame. Then you will melt the DataFrame using the `melt()` function and perform some manipulation on the DataFrame. Keep in mind that melting helps us better organize our data by reformatting it into a longer and more usable form.

## Instructions

1. Melt the DataFrame using the `melt()` function.

2. Melt the DataFrame using the runner_name column.

3. Melt the DataFrame using the coach_name column.

4. Rename the columns.

5. Remove coach_name from the DataFrame.

6. Show the final DataFrame.

7. Save the final DataFrame to a CSV file.
