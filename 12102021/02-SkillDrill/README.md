# HR Employee Attrition

In this skill drill, you are being asked to build a predictive model from scratch that answers the question: “who is more likely to leave a company?” using HR Employee Attrition data (ie Education, Job Satisfaction, Performance Rating, etc). Use this dataset to create two logistic regression models to make your prediction. The first model should follow the basic steps to split, model, fit, & predict. The second model should balance the data splitting to evaluate if predicitons of the postive class `Attrition` are more accurate when balancing. 

## Instructions

1. Import the required dependencies.

2. Read the csv file into a pandas DataFrame.

3. Select our independent X variables, and our dependent y variable.

4. Confirm imblance of target variable 'Attrition'.

5. Create Validation training and testing datasets without balancing.

6. Confirm imblance of target variable 'Attrition' in the test dataset.

7. Create a Linear Regression model object.

8. Train the model using the training datasets.

9. Make predictions using the testing dataset.

10. Plot the Confusion Matrix values.

11. Plot the Confusion Matrix prediction percentages.

12. Print the classification report.

13. Create our Validation training and testing datasets with balancing.

14. Repeat steps 6 through 12 for the newly balanced datasets and compare the overall prediction of the positive label `Attrition`.
