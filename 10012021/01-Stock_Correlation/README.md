## Instructions

1. Import the Pandas and Plotly Express libraries.

1. Read the CSV file into a DataFrame and set the `date` column as the index.

1. Use the `pct_change` function to calculate the daily returns. Drop `n/a` values. 

1. Use the `corr` function on the combined DataFrame to calculate and output a correlation table of each stock-to-stock pair.

1. Use the `imshow` function from the Plotly library to create a heatmap of correlation values. **Hint:** You can read more about creating heatmaps in the [Plotly documentation](https://plotly.com/python/heatmaps/).
