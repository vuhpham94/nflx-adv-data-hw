# Titanic Survival

In this skill drill, you are being asked to build a predictive model from scratch that answers the question: “who is more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). Use this dataset to create a logistic regression model to make your prediction. Try multiple iteraions to see the highest accuracy you can predict. 

## Instructions

1. Import the required dependencies.

2. Read the csv file into a pandas DataFrame.

3. Select our independent X variables, and our dependent y variable.

4. Confirm the independent variable data types are numeric.

5. Create Validation training and testing datasets.

6. Create a Linear Regression model object.

7. Train the model using the training datasets.

8. Make predictions using the `X` testing dataset.

9. Score the model with the testing datasets and predictions.

10. Create a DataFrame of results.

11. Plot the ROC curve to visualize your models accuracy rate.
