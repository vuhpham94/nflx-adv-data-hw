# Unit 9 Assessment

Today's assessment covers the past unit - Statistical Modeling. All of the questions for this assessment are contained within the [provided jupyter notebook](Unsolved/Unit_9_Assessment.ipynb).

# Notes

* Depending on the question, you may need to write code or type your selection from a set of multiple choice options. Read each question carefully to ensure that your answer matches the intended format.

* Some of the questions in this assessment require you to import datasets from files located in the [Unsolved](Unsolved/) folder. **You do not need to submit the datasets with your submission notebook**

* This assessment has been issued using a jupyter notebook, which means that you can run code and edit code blocks freely. You may create additional code blocks to help you answer the assessment questions, as long as it is **very** clear where your answers are for each assessment questions

    * If your notebook is too difficult to read and/or your answers are not clearly identified, you may recieve a `0` for that question. 

    * We recommend you make a copy of the assessment notebook to use as you work through each question. Once you complete a question transfer your answer to your submission notebook.
